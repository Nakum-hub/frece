FRECE (File Recovery Console) - README

## Introduction
**FRECE (File Recovery Console)** is a powerful Python-based tool designed for data recovery, specifically aimed at restoring deleted log files and other crucial data on Linux-based systems. This tool can assist cyber forensics professionals in performing detailed investigations on lost or deleted files.

## Features
- Recover deleted log files
- User-friendly interface for data recovery
- Python-based with easy installation and setup

## Prerequisites
Before installing FRECE, ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- Linux-based operating system (Kali Linux preferred)
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Python package manager `pip`
- Required Python dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
If you haven't already downloaded the project, you can clone it using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/frece.git
cd frece
```

### 2. Grant Execution Permissions to the Install Script
Make sure the `install.sh` script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```

### 3. Run the Install Script
Execute the installation script with `sudo` to set up the necessary environment and dependencies:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

### 4. Create a Symbolic Link (Optional)
If you want to easily run the `frece.py` script from anywhere in the terminal, create a symbolic link:

```bash
sudo ln -s ~/frece/frece.py /usr/local/bin/frece
```

If the symbolic link already exists and you get the error `ln: failed to create symbolic link '/usr/local/bin/frece': File exists`, you can remove the old link and recreate it.

```bash
# Remove existing symbolic link
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/frece

# Create a new symbolic link
sudo ln -s ~/frece/frece.py /usr/local/bin/frece
```

### 5. Install Dependencies
FRECE requires some Python dependencies. You can install them via `pip`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Run the Tool
Once everything is set up, you can run the `frece` tool from anywhere in the terminal:

```bash
frece
```

If you encounter any errors, refer to the troubleshooting section below for common issues.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `ln: failed to create symbolic link '/usr/local/bin/frece': File exists`

This error occurs if a symbolic link or file already exists at the target location. To fix this:
1. Remove the existing symbolic link:

    ```bash
    sudo rm /usr/local/bin/frece
    ```

2. Recreate the symbolic link:

    ```bash
    sudo ln -s ~/frece/frece.py /usr/local/bin/frece
    ```

### Error: Missing Python Dependencies

If you encounter missing module errors or dependency issues, ensure that you have installed the required packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If the dependencies are still not working, consider reinstalling the tool and dependencies:

```bash
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

### Error: Permission Denied During Installation

If you face permission issues while installing, make sure you are running the installation script as `sudo`:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

## Common Cleanup and Maintenance Commands

To resolve general system errors, clear old packages, and maintain your environment, use the following commands:

### 1. Update System and Remove Old Packages
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get clean
```

### 2. Reset Python Environment
If the Python environment is causing issues, you can create a new virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv  # Install virtual environment tools
python3 -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the environment
```
